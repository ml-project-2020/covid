## Motivation
The current pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents an unprecedented challenge to the global economy. Herculean efforts have been made to analyze, predict, and model the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic to guide relevant policy. However, the majority of this analysis has revolved around just a handful of countries. In particular the USA, China, Italy, Spain, UK, Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore . Some characteristics of virus spread and its socioeconomic impacts are most probably shared among a majority of countries. Nonetheless, in order to provide data-driven policy advice to individual countries, analysis and modeling should be done on national-level data. With under-funded healthcare systems2, institutional-weakness, and large informal economic sectors, Mexico faces a gigantic challenge to contain the virus. Unfortunately, like many other developing countries3, there is a dearth of analysis with respect to Mexico. With this project, we hope to shed some light on the public health crises currently unfolding in and, more importantly, provide data-driven policy recommendations to combat the pandemic. **Ultimately we seek to develop a covid19 vulnerability index based on health, economic, and disease transmission data at the municipality level**.
